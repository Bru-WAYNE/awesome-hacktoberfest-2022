### 5 Best Coding Games to Advance Your Programming Skills

## Though, since that time, Gaming has undergone a gigantic transformation and the incorporation of advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Cloud, and others have made it more extensive and revolutionary. As per the reports, there are around 300 Million gamers across the nation and the number is increasing significantly.

# But wait…!! What’s there for you?  

Okay, so as mentioned above that gaming has become such a vast territory in itself – you need to understand that now Gaming is no more only a hobby (yes, you heard it right). From a programmer’s perspective, there are a lot of coding games available over the web and you can use these gaming platforms to learn and sharpen your programming skills in a more entertaining way. You can make use of these coding games as fun breaks during your learning process to get refreshed with practicing your coding skills simultaneously.

Moreover, it will also help you to empower your creativity and problem-solving skills as you need to solve various challenging problems and have to compete with various proficient programmers across the world.

Here, in this article, we’ve figured out several worthwhile coding games that’ll surely help you to level up your programming skills:

## 1. **Untrusted**
The Continuing Adventures of Dr. Eval!

Untrusted is an online adventure game designed for individuals who want to practice and test their JavaScript skills. In this game, you’re required to use JavaScript commands to guide Dr. Eval through a machine continuum and alter his reality to get freedom. The game provides you with a rogue-like gaming environment and a console window with the JavaScript code generating each level. And you’d be able to access all the source codes but to save yourself, you need to make the required changes to the source code.

The game has multiple levels such as the cellBlockA in which you need to figure out the code that generates the walls and remove it, the theLongWayOut in which you need to create a new exit, and many more. The game is quite a fun journey if you possess some good knowledge of JavaScript concepts and programming. The interface of the game looks like:

2. Robocode
Wouldn’t it be great to practice your coding skills by programming the robot tanks that fight against each other (sound exciting, right?).

Yes, you can do the same with this renowned game – Robocode. Robocode allows you to develop a robot battle tank using programming languages like Java or .NET to battle against other tanks. You need to write the AI for the robot to let it know what to do and how to reacts to events happening in the battleground.

The game is very useful to learn & practice several programming languages such as Java, Scala, and C#. It also helps you get into the Artificial Intelligence domain. Moreover, Robocode provides you with a complete development environment and comes up with its own installer, built-in robot editor, & Java compiler. Also, Robocode is an Open Source project and you all are welcome to come up with your own add-ons or modes to showcase your development skills

## 3. Elevator Saga
Elevator Saga helps you to showcase your JavaScript skills in the context of programming the movement of elevators to transport people efficiently. There are various challenges such as transport 15 people in 60 seconds or less, etc. and the challenges gradually become harder. You need to come up with an optimized algorithm to reduce the waiting time for the passengers. The game is indeed very beneficial to work on your JavaScript skills and algorithm optimization approaches.

Moreover, the interface of Elevator Saga is quite simple as all you need to enter your code in the input window and click on the Apply button to start the challenge. Some of the code examples for Elevator Saga are given below to give you a broad idea:

To inform the elevator to go to Floor 1: elevator.goToFloor(1);
To stop the elevator if it is moving: elevator.stop();
